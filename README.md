## Doubts, questions, advice... üìñ

I am currently training in the branch of web application development and I have developed this project as part of my training. If you are a person like me who is learning and you have any questions about some of the code, do not hesitate to ask me and I will try to solve your doubts.

If on the other hand you are a knowledgeable person in this world and you see errors or things that should be improved in the development of the application, I would appreciate your advice.
